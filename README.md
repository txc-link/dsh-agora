## The Problem

Putting many agents into one channel does produce better ideas, but it also produces failure modes:

- Discussion noise drowns the task.
- Coordinators get context-polluted.
- Human approval becomes informal and easy to skip.
- Execution starts before decisions are actually settled.
- Chat logs do not equal delivery.

The deeper problem is not "how to connect another bot". It is:

**How do you build a social structure where the right participants see the right information at the right time?**

Agora answers that with explicit orchestration semantics instead of prompt folklore.

---

## What Agora Is

Agora is:

- an orchestration core
- a governance layer
- a task arena with staged participation
- a human-gated decision system
- a provider-neutral execution control plane

Agora is **not**:

- just another IM bot
- just a coding-agent launcher
- just a Claude/Codex/Gemini wrapper
- a runtime that owns the low-level session substrate

The low-level coding runtime is now treated as commodity infrastructure. Agora keeps the orchestration truth.

---

## Core Model

```text
Citizens deliberate  ->  Archon decides  ->  Executors deliver
```

| Concept | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Agora** | The task arena: isolated context, workflow, participants, notifications |
| **Citizens** | Discussion participants: agents that can debate, critique, and refine proposals |
| **Archon** | Human authority at gates: approves, rejects, pauses, or redirects |
| **Craftsman** | A governed execution role, not a self-owned runtime framework |
| **Gate** | A stage transition checkpoint with explicit policy |
| **Decree** | A curated brief or accepted decision that execution is allowed to act on |

The key idea is simple:

> For executors, much discussion is noise.

Executors do not always need the full debate log. Often they need a curated brief, accepted constraints, and permission to act.

That is why Agora distinguishes:

- `execution-only` participants
- `dialogue-capable` participants

Both can exist in the same task system, but they are governed differently.

---

## How It Works

1. Citizens discuss in an isolated task context.
2. Archon reviews the current conclusion at a gate.
3. Agora decides whether execution may start, who may join, and what brief they receive.
4. Execution runs through a provider-neutral substrate.
5. Results flow back into task state, logs, notifications, and archive.

Discussion stays flexible. Delivery stays controlled.

---

## Execution Model

Agora no longer treats its old tmux-based Craftsman path as the primary execution model.

Current position:

- `ACPX` is the default execution substrate.
- `tmux` remains available only as a legacy fallback/debug adapter.
- `CraftsmanAdapter` remains a Core-facing abstraction.
- `Craftsman` remains a business role in orchestration.
- The old tmux public shell has been removed.

This means Agora focuses on:

- when execution starts
- who gets to execute
- whether an executor joins the discussion
- what context the executor receives
- how completion flows back into orchestration state

It does **not** need to be the project that owns every low-level Claude/Codex session primitive itself.

---

## Why Not Just Put Claude In The Channel?

You can. Agora does not fight that.

If a user wants to connect Claude, Codex, or another agent host directly into Discord/OpenClaw, that is fine. Agora still has a job:

- decide when that participant joins
- decide when they stay hidden
- decide whether they receive the whole discussion or only a brief
- decide when human review is mandatory
- decide how output changes task state

Direct IM presence solves transport. It does not solve governance.

---

## Architecture

```text
IM / Entry Adapters
Discord · Feishu · Slack · Dashboard · CLI · REST
                |
                v
Agora Core / Orchestrator
Task · Context · Participant · Gate · Approval
Scheduler · Notification · Archive · Recovery
                |
                v
Runtime / Execution Adapters
Hosted runtimes: DSH · OpenClaw · Hermes · future hosts
Execution substrates: ACPX (default) · tmux (legacy fallback)
```

Core rule:

- `packages/core` owns orchestration semantics.
- IM, runtime, and execution systems are adapters.
- Provider-specific details must not become the long-term Core model.
- Current runtime posture is single-core, dual-adapter: ACPX is the default path, while tmux stays as a legacy adapter.

---

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- `acpx`

Optional:

- OpenClaw or Hermes, if you want an existing agent runtime governed by Agora
- Discord, if you want the live thread experience
- Docker plus an embedding API, if you want `project brain` hybrid retrieval instead of raw lexical search

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FairladyZ625/Agora.git
cd Agora
./scripts/bootstrap-local.sh
```

### Initialize And Start

```bash
./agora init
./agora start
```

If OpenClaw is detected, `./agora init` can optionally help wire the local Agora plugin into `openclaw.json`.
The stable manual path is still:

```bash
openclaw plugins install -l ./extensions/agora-plugin
openclaw config set plugins.entries.agora.config.serverUrl http://127.0.0.1:18008
```

It only automates safe plugin registration and Agora server wiring.
It does **not** rewrite OpenClaw Discord policy such as bot rosters, `allowBots`, `requireMention`, or guild/channel allowlists.

DSH users can install the native thin adapter instead:

```bash
cd extensions/dsh-agora
npm install && npm test
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/Agora/extensions/dsh-agora
```

See [Doc/dsh-integration.md](Doc/dsh-integration.md) for the command surface, security boundary, and the versioned dsh-im collaboration contract.

The DSH adapter also exposes OpenClaw CLI and Hermes Runs API runtimes, durable budgeted coordination (`single`, `fanout`, `review`, `debate`, `council`), evidence/conflict synthesis, Agent Scorecards, scoped node credentials, layered memory, content-addressed artifacts, governed merge proposals, and an A2A 1.0 HTTP+JSON boundary. The complete operator guide is in [extensions/dsh-agora/README.md](extensions/dsh-agora/README.md); the design boundary is recorded in [Doc/03-ARCHITECTURE/dsh-agora-coordination-and-federation-v1.md](Doc/03-ARCHITECTURE/dsh-agora-coordination-and-federation-v1.md).

Calendar and personal-task integrations follow the same adapter rule: set `CALENDAR_PROVIDER=google` for Google Calendar and `TICKTICK_ACCESS_TOKEN` for TickTick Open API. Agora persists only the Task ↔ external task ↔ calendar event relationship in `planning_bindings`, never provider tokens. Consented bindings can synchronize terminal state in both directions: TickTick completion advances an active Agora task to `done`, cancellation/deletion advances it to `cancelled`, and Agora completion/cancellation is projected back without merging mutable titles or dates. Conflicts are persisted instead of resolved by last-writer-wins. See [the provider/runtime adapter decision](Doc/03-ARCHITECTURE/2026-09-01-provider-runtime-adapters/README.md) and [the state-sync decision](Doc/03-ARCHITECTURE/2026-09-01-planning-bidirectional-sync/README.md).

If you want semantic `project brain` retrieval, `./agora init` now offers an optional setup phase that:

- collects your embedding API settings
- verifies the embedding endpoint with a real probe request
- reuses a healthy local Qdrant on `127.0.0.1:6333` when available
- otherwise starts `qdrant/qdrant:latest` locally through Docker
- writes the verified vector config into the repo-root `.env`

That is the primary product path. Manual `.env` editing remains available as a fallback:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
OPENAI_EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=
QDRANT_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6333
QDRANT_API_KEY=
```

With that configured, these commands switch from raw lexical search to hybrid retrieval:

```bash
./agora projects brain index rebuild --project <project_id>
./agora projects brain query --task <task_id> --audience craftsman --query "runtime boundary" --mode auto
./agora projects brain bootstrap-context --task <task_id> --audience craftsman
```

For the end-to-end bootstrap guide, see:

- [Doc/06-INTEGRATIONS/openclaw/agora-openclaw-bootstrap-whitepaper.md](./Doc/06-INTEGRATIONS/openclaw/agora-openclaw-bootstrap-whitepaper.md)

### Developer Live Regression Mode

Agora now supports a developer-only live regression harness for real Discord task threads.
When enabled, the local agent can use AgoraBot as an operator proxy in `regression_test` tasks and drive live smoke/regression loops through the normal orchestration path.

Enable it explicitly in the repo-root `.env`:

```bash
AGORA_DEV_REGRESSION_MODE=true
AGORA_DASHBOARD_LOGIN_USER=
AGORA_DASHBOARD_LOGIN_PASSWORD=
```

This mode is for source-level developers iterating on Agora itself.
Keep it disabled for normal product usage.

Typical commands:

```bash
cd agora-ts
npm run dev -w @agora-ts/cli -- dashboard session login
npm run smoke:discord:regression
npm run dev -w @agora-ts/cli -- regression live --task-id <task_id> --goal "validate the current Discord flow" --message "Drive this task forward and report what blocks you."
```

When `AGORA_DEV_REGRESSION_MODE=true`, `agora dashboard session login` can read `AGORA_DASHBOARD_LOGIN_USER` / `AGORA_DASHBOARD_LOGIN_PASSWORD` directly from the repo-root `.env`.

Default local endpoints:

- API: `http://127.0.0.1:18008/api/health`
- Dashboard: `http://127.0.0.1:33173/dashboard/`

### Create A Task

```bash
./agora create "Add authentication middleware to the API"
```

### Typical Flow

```text
Create task
  -> Citizens discuss
  -> Archon reviews
  -> execution-only or dialogue-capable executor is selected
  -> ACPX-backed execution runs
  -> output is reviewed and archived
```

### Quality Gates

```bash
cd agora-ts
npm run check:strict
npm run scenario:all
```

## Use Cases

- requirement clarification with competing agent viewpoints
- architecture and implementation review with explicit human gates
- code/test/review delivery after discussion converges
- project and context isolation across multiple agent groups
- selective participant exposure in long-running task threads
- auditable human-in-the-loop orchestration for real work
